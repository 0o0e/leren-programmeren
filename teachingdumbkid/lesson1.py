# u see this??? ok


# ok so first strings
# a string has to have "" this or '' u cant mix them. so "' is not good
# okay so u know what a value is? and variable? type in discord     okay examples:::

# u cant mix " and ' 


# OK
# first math

# ok so for multiplication use *
# so for example 2 * 1 = 2
# okay so divison is /
# example is  10 / 2 = 5
# and + and - are the same so 5-1=4 and 3+2 = 5

# now for if statements
# u can test a condition with if statements. for example.   answer in discord
# okay so this input is a string rn, so to make it a number u have to put int in front
howtallareu = int(input("how tall are u?"))
# now its int

# ok so we can test with an if statement if ur taller than average or if ur shorter
# so lets say average height is 10 cm

# nvm i forgot to teahc u something

# okay so there are 3 kinds:
# if, elif and else
# u always use if first. and if u want to test multiple things u use elif
# elif basically means else if, so if the first if isnt true it goes to elif, and if the first if IS true it skips the elif. okay
# example:

if howtallareu < 10:
    print("ur shorter than average")
elif howtallareu > 10:
    print("ur taller than average")
else:
    print("ur exactly average height")

# so if both of those arent true u can add an else. u dont have to add a condition in an else (u know what condition is right?)its this: howtallareu >= 10:
